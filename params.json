{"name":"Samepins.GitHub.io","tagline":"community guideline","body":"### What is SamePins?\r\n\r\nThe objective of this website is to provide a community curated guide to ensuring consistent pinouts (When possible and practical) between electronic modules, in such a way that ideally would allow for \"plug and play\" wiring. Especially amongst the open hardware community.\r\n\r\nFor example i2c may be an electrical standard, but there is no consistent pinout between modules. So in the case of i2c, since connectors type do vary, you could have a set of different suggestion for different connectors etc... (E.g. one for header pins, one for trrs plugs, or twisted pairs).\r\n\r\nFor ICs footprints. Well obviously you can't mandate a standard pinout. But you can at least observe the most common pinouts, and at least let people know about that. (e.g. Seems like LDO pinouts are pretty consistent for many chips). Defacto standards like the [ 7400 Series ]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series ) is a good candadate.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we hope to encourage consistent pinouts for modules and ICs as if it was a \"semi-standard\" [cue xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/927/) . To this end, we propose both a set of community curated \"semi-standards\" pinout/footprint/electrical compatibility guides, and a visual marker to indicate compatibility to these \"semi-standards\".\r\n\r\n### To Do:\r\n\r\n* Create draft for \"community pinout guideline pages\" for i2c, etc...\r\n\r\n* Create draft for \"defacto industry footprint\" observations. E.g. Common LDO pinouts for through holes and surface mounts.\r\n\r\n* Eventually finalize these pinouts, and then promote these pinouts suggestions.\r\n\r\n* Create a visual mark for indicating compatibility.\r\n\r\n* (Far future): Encourage a 2D barcode encoding of ICs footprint and pinouts for easy transfer of footprint to EDAs like altium or kicad.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrent Maintainer: @mofosyne\r\n\r\n### GitHub Repo!\r\n\r\nGot a suggestion, or push you want to do?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mofosyne/samepins.github.io\r\n\r\n### Where is the website source?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mofosyne/samepins.github.io/tree/gh-pages\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
